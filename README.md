# Intro To Cherrypy

Coming 21-Sep-2016 (Presentation is at 6pm sharp!)

##BEWARE!!! This is a work in progress, Lots of Broken Here...

**A programmers tutorial on building a full stack app using the Cherrypy web server, [START HERE](https://mopig-pnw.github.io/IntroToCherrypy/)**

This tutorial is intended for working programmers that alreay know Python 3.4+ and want to add the Cherry Pie application framework to their stack. The first tutorial BasicCherry-Tutorial.py has some additional comments in the code. We start from the simplest possible app. Next we step through mapping the [MVC](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~dwigdor/teaching/csc2524/2012_F/papers/mvc.pdf) pattern onto classes, application server configuration files, serving static pages, building a [CRUD](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25949/create-retrieve-update-and-delete-crud) interface, adding an [SQLlite3](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/sqlite3.html) DB, and planning a [REST](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) interface for our app. Finally we finish off with a ready to go application template that you can easily extend if you have worked the entire tutorial. 

Takes about 4 hours start to finish if you do your own typing.
